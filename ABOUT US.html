    <h3 id="P1">&nbsp; History</h3>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left" id="hh">Adama Hospital Medical College (AHMC) was previously known by the names of Hayile Mariam Mamo Memorial Hospital and Adama Referral Public Hospital at different times. It is one of the 1st Medical Hospital situated in Adama town, located in Oromia Region, 100 km to southeast of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Hospital was inaugurated by missionaries from abroad in 1938 E.C and it was among the 1st non-governmental Hospitals in the nation with persistent commitment the pursuit to establish as the nation's leading health care provider. Then the hospital developed its facilities, technology, service standards and personnel to become a renowned institution. It was put under government during the dergue region in 1970 E.C.</p>
  <p align="left" id="hh">The Hospital was upgraded to Medical College in 2003 E.C because of its location, patient load and staff capacity. The College is led by the board and has three major wings (Academic and research, Health service and the Development and Administration). Till now, the Hospital College has undergone different reforms (BPR, BSC, HMIS, KPI, HCF, EHRIG and CASH). To implement these reforms the Health Development Armies (HAD) were organized at different levels. The Hospital is serving a catchment population of more than 6million; from five regions (Oromia, Amhara, Afar, Somali, and Dire-Dawa). The Hospital has 232 beds capacity and serving on average 1000 patients/day at six medical case teams (OPDs) and different specialty clinics.</p>
  <p align="left" id="history">In general, AHMC is providing services using all available material, financial and human resources. Because of improved services, the number of patients coming to the Hospital College is increasing from day to day. If the number continues at this rate, the Hospital College will reach a position where it can no longer provide efficient service for the community. The Hospital College has tried to expand its existing facilities for the fundamental transformation, and the construction of the new Hospital College complex was designed and started to be constructed with the cost of nearly one billion ETB. At the completion, the new buildings will be expected to have 1200 bed capacity, diagnostic facilities, offices, classrooms and the like. Indeed, the constructions were planned in three phases. The first phase of ward complex, OPD, emergency, classrooms and Administration blocks are on the way of about to be completed.</p>
