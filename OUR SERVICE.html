        <p>An emergency room is also equipped to handle surgeries and often has a trauma center, which treats major injuries from things like big falls or gunshot wounds. Some hospitals also offer specialized emergency care, like a pediatric emergency department for children.</p>

      <p>Short-term inpatient hospitalization may be the right choice to help your loved one in an emergency. Short-term inpatient hospitalization is best for clients who are at immediate risk of harming themselves or others or who are experiencing severe psychosis. Because the goal of short-term inpatient hospitalization is to stabilize the client, not cure him/her, staff will focus on making a diagnosis and forming a longer-term treatment plan. Staff will also administer medical care, support, and supervision during the client&rsquo;s stay. The hospitalization may also include therapeutic activities to help the client stabilize.</p>
      <p>Depending on the hospital and available resources, a short-term inpatient hospital team may include psychiatrists, psychologists, registered nurses, speech-language pathologists, and occupational and recreational therapists. A hospital stay may also include specialized tests so that proper diagnoses can be made. Some of these programs may offer educational resources for youth so that credit can be earned for work done during the hospital stay.</p>
      <p>During a short-term hospital stay, the treatment team will work closely with the patient and family members to develop an individualized long-term treatment plan. Typically, a longer-term treatment plan will include individual therapy, behavior management, medication, and family counseling.</p>

        <p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0">Radiology is the field of medicine that uses imaging techniques (such as X-rays) to diagnose and treat disease. It may be used diagnostically in order to determine if a medical condition is present or not (such as finding a lung cancer), interventionally as a procedure (such as removing a blood clot in an artery), or as a treatment. such as giving radiation therapy to treat cancer.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-31">X-rays or plain radiographs are often done to look at bones, the chest, or the abdomen. With X-rays, denser structures, such as bones, appear white (opaque) whereas air filled areas (such as the lungs) appear black. Most structures of the body are in shades of gray between these two.</p>
